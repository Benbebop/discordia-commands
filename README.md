# Discordia Commands

A library for [Discordia 2](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) that provides Application Command support. I tried to keep everything as close to Discordia as possible, so it should be fairly familiar.

# Installation

I won't be putting this on Lit, so you will have to clone it.

1. Follow the instructions for installing [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia).
2. `cd` into your bot directory.
3. Then run `git clone https://github.com/Benbebop/discordia-commands ./deps/discordia-commands`

You should then have a folder named `discordia-commands` in your deps folder.
